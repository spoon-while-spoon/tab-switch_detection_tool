# Browser Permission and Tab-Switch Detection Tool
This project provides a simple JavaScript tool to test various browser behaviors that might be monitored during an online assessment. It detects tab-switching, requests permissions for camera, microphone, and notifications, and checks the fullscreen mode status. This project is useful for understanding how browsers handle common permission requests and for testing tab-switch detection.

## Features
- __Tab-Switch Detection:__ Logs whenever the user switches away from or returns to the tab.
- __Camera and Microphone Permission Requests:__ Asks for access to the camera and microphone and logs whether access was granted or denied.
- __Notification Permission Requests:__ Requests permission to send notifications and logs the result.
- __Fullscreen Mode Detection:__ Checks if the page is in fullscreen mode and logs any change to or from fullscreen.
- __Automatic Fullscreen Activation:__ Attempts to activate fullscreen mode after a brief delay to test fullscreen permissions.

## How It Works
This tool leverages various JavaScript events and API requests:

1. `window.onblur` and `window.onfocus` events: Detect when the user switches tabs or windows.

2. `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` : Requests permission for camera and microphone.

3. `Notification.requestPermission()` : Requests permission for notifications.

4. `document.fullscreenElement` and `fullscreenchange event` : Monitors changes in fullscreen mode.

## Usage
### 1. Clone or Download
Clone the repository or download the file to use this code locally or in an online editor like CodePen, JSFiddle, or JSBin.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Browser-Permission-and-Tab-Switch-Detection.git
cd Browser-Permission-and-Tab-Switch-Detection
```

### 2. Open the File
Open `index.html` in a browser. The console (`F12` > Console tab) will display all logs generated by the tool, while messages will also appear on the webpage.

### 3. Grant or Deny Permissions
The tool will request permissions for:

- __Camera and Microphone:__ You'll be prompted to allow or deny access.
- __Notifications:__ You'll be prompted to allow or deny notifications.
You can observe the responses and how they are logged in real-time.

### 4. Test Tab-Switching and Fullscreen
Switch to other tabs and back to see how the tool logs each event. You can also manually enter fullscreen mode, or let the tool attempt to activate it after a few seconds.

## Code Breakdown
- `getTimeStamp` __function:__ Generates a timestamp for logging purposes.
- `logMessage` __function:__ Logs a message to both the webpage and console, including a timestamp.
- `requestCameraAndMicrophone` __function:__ Requests camera and microphone permissions and logs the result.
- `requestNotificationPermission` __function:__ Requests notification permissions and logs the result.
- `checkFullScreenStatus` __function:__ Logs when the page enters or exits fullscreen mode.
- `setTimeout` __for fullscreen activation:__ Attempts to activate fullscreen mode after a delay to see if it is allowed.

## Example Output
When running the code, you might see outputs like:

```makefile
12:34:56 - 01/01/2024: Tab switched or window left
12:35:00 - 01/01/2024: Back in the tab
12:35:05 - 01/01/2024: Camera and microphone access granted
12:35:10 - 01/01/2024: Notifications permission: granted
12:35:15 - 01/01/2024: Entered fullscreen mode
12:35:20 - 01/01/2024: Exited fullscreen mode
```
_These logs provide a record of the browserâ€™s responses to permissions, fullscreen actions, and tab switches._
